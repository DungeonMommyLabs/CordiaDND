## Overview

Green Wood Forest is a lush expanse of woodland nestled between rolling hills and gentle streams. Spread across tens of miles, it boasts a diverse ecosystem, with towering oak and maple trees dominating the canopy. Sunlight filters through the dense foliage, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor below.  

Wildflowers carpet the ground, painting the forest floor with vibrant colours, while ferns and mosses thrive in the damp, shaded areas. Squirrels chatter overhead as they leap from branch to branch, and birdsong fills the air with melodies.Numerous streams meander through the forest, providing fresh water to the inhabitants and creating small, tranquil pools where fish and amphibians make their homes. The occasional waterfall cascades down rocky outcrops  

Green Wood Forest is a sanctuary for many creatures, from the elusive deer to the playful foxes and rabbits that dart among the underbrush. Rangers and druids often roam its trails, keeping a watchful eye on the balance of nature and ensuring the forest remains unspoiled by outside threats.
