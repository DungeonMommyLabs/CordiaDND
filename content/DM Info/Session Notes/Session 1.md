# Recap 
loraquin ran away when she saw python, the ork from her dream/nightmare. a little later she noticed she was being followed when she was travelling back to her grove elders for advice. After narrowly escaping the would-be captors, she ran back to the city hoping to shake the bandits. When she got back into the city she hid on a roof and before she knew it she was caught by a bandit captain and dragged to mistres wolfs manor. A little later the rest of the gang gets there after “saving” “her child”. Mistress  [[Characters/Localised NPC's/Viscanthspire/Alexandria, The She-Wolf]] invited them in for dinner and reward, though, they themselves were intended for dinner. They find themselves with a very lost child, named [[Characters/NPC's/Avery Hopkins]]. Avery is far from home she is likely from a town near ember mountains on the other side of the country.
