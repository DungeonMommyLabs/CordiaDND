# Recap
The party found a stump in [[Places/Greenwood Forest/Greenwood Forest]] on this stump they found a U-rune. 
[[Players/BLOO]] rolled a Nat20 for religion, and realised they have met people that use that lexicon and believe in a pantheon of gods, An ancient civilisation.
After doing an arcana check the runes emanate a small amount of magic from an unknown source deep deep beneath the forest floor
[[Characters/Antagonists/Python DECEASED]] thinks they are heretics and finds them icky and wants to eliminate it
