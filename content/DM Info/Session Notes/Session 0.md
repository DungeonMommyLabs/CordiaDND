# Intro to the setting
You wake up in your bed, sweaty, with the feeling of utmost importance and urgency as if the world was about to end, having had the weirdest and most vivid dream

You scramble to recall the details of the dream, but they slip away like water through your fingers, leaving only fragments and a lingering sense of foreboding. As you shake off the remnants of sleep, you realise something, it is Temple day and YOU'RE LATE

You rush to get ready, throwing on your clothes and hastily grabbing your belongings. As you are about to leave you see, from the corner of your eye, something that's not supposed to be there, something that cannot have gotten there. A letter with a red, no… crimson, wax seal lying on a table. Nobody put that letter there. Some of you found the letter in their pocket or bag later our feline and orc friend found it in their respective bag and pocket.

Curiosity mingled with a hint of apprehension, you pick up the letter. You look at the letter, it looks quite worn and old, yet with its seal completely intact as if waiting for you to open it. Your heart beats as you carefully open the letter, your mind races with questions. Who left this here? What could be inside? And most importantly, Does it have something to do with your dream?

As you open the letter – a feeling that your life is about to change in ways you never imagined, a sense of destiny washes over you. 

In the distance you hear the temple bells and you get shaken back into the here and now. You open your front door and dash through the bustling streets of town, you can feel the weight of your lateness pressing down on you like a cloak of steel. The sun is already high in the sky, casting harsh shadows on the cobblestones as you navigate the crowded streets.

As you approach the grand temple, you hear chanting drifting through the air, punctuated by the tolling of bells. Panic gnaws at your mind as you push your way through the temple doors, your breath coming in ragged gasps. Some eyes turn towards you as you stumble into the sanctuary, the ceremony remains barely unshattered by your tardy arrival.

But as you catch your breath and take in the scene before you, a sense of unease settles in the pit of your stomach. There is something different about today—something ominous lurking beneath the surface—something you had never noticed until now, could it be because of that letter? Because of that dream?
