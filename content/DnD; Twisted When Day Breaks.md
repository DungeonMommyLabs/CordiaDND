### World

The campaign takes place in a strictly monotheistic society. with the main deity being the king of gods, [[Characters/Antagonists/Scarlet King]].

Followers of other deities are considered heretics and will be ostracised, converted or killed.

  

People live a relatively normal life, going to the temple every week to worship the Scarlet, as is required 
If you're a heretic you learn to keep your head down, and attend the king of gods worship anyway.
You all live in the same city Viscanthspire in the middle of the continent
