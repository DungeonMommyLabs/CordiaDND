# Overview
Tabaxi are cat-like humanoids known for their curiosity and wanderlust, often driven by a desire to explore and collect stories rather than wealth. They typically have slender bodies covered in fur, with traits resembling various feline species, and they are skilled in stealth and agility, making them exceptional hunters and adventurers.
Believed to be created by the Cat Lord, a divine being of the Upper Planes. *This so called "Cat Lord" is obviously non existent, for a cat lord can not and does not really exist in the presence of the [[New vault structure/Characters/Antagonists/Scarlet King]]*. They blend qualities of humanoids and cats, tabaxi are a varied people in both attitude and appearance. In some lands, tabaxi live like the cats they resemble, naturally curious and at home in playful environments. In other places, tabaxi live as other folk do, not exhibiting the feline behavior the supposed Cat Lord intended.
Tabaxiâ€™s appearance is as varied as their attitudes. Some tabaxi have features or patterning in their fur like tigers, jaguars, or other big cats, while others have appearances more like a house cat. Still others have unique patterns or might style their fur to their preferences, or might even be hairless!
