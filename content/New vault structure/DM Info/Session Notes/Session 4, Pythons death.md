During the fight with python [[New vault structure/Players/James Ravenhoorn]] died and got resurrected bij a grace of [[New vault structure/Characters/NPC's/Tyr, the Goddes of war, diplomacy, and peace]] saying he has a bigger role yet to play. during the fight [[New vault structure/Characters/NPC's/Avery Hopkins]] banged on the door hoping to get in but couldn't because [[New vault structure/Characters/Antagonists/Python DECEASED]] had locked the door as one of their last action. when the fight was over [[New vault structure/Players/James Ravenhoorn]]was unconscious, [[New vault structure/Players/Mikaela Mittens]] was barely standing and [[New vault structure/Players/BLOO]] was relatively ok.
Bloo walked out first, only to find [[New vault structure/Characters/NPC's/Avery Hopkins]] on the floor with a white-ish muzzle instead of their normal face, crying and sobbing with what seems to be an ice blast originating from their mouth.
