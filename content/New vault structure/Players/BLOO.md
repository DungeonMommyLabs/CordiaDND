# The Life of Blue
## Family & Pre Mortem

- They were 15 years old when they died and were dead for a 200 years
  
- Their mom killed them 
  
- Because a dragon human hybrid was to be burned at the stake and bearing such a child and letting it live also was reason to get burned on the stake like a witch
  
- Their dad is still alive and out there.
  
- Bloo used to be called Zymm before their death

## Post Mortem

- They’ve tried out the all of the afterlives for 150 years and spend 50 years in the world of the living

- after spending those 50 years as a remnant they don't remember all the afterlives until they are among living once again 
   
- Sometimes they forget that they're not dead anymore, you bump into people walls doors and objects and have no filter and just say what you think because you forget that people can hear you now

- You made maps of the afterlives you just don't know how to get there they look like modern art to normal

## Secunda Vitae

- They remember the afterlives but don't know how to get there. All they know is that they died and saw all these different places. 

- They come back and people are saying there's only one true god with one afterlife, leaving them very confused because they saw many afterlives and religions attributed to those afterlives.

- They were brought back to life by a god, Tyr, god of War, Justice, and Peace. Brought back for reasons yet unknown to them.

- Why?

- To stop the Scarlet king from conquering the multiverse

- They see their new life as a second opportunity and really LIVE that life. and thus don't say no to new experiences
  
- After being resurrected Bloo can now commune with ghost once every short rest
