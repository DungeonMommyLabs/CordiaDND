## Description
Through the forest runs a creek from up high in the mountain range. This small looking creek meanders throughout the woods, it eventually permeates in a cave. In and near the cave it'sÂ  looking way bigger, water rushing in and sloshing all over. In this cave had formed a stone path from years of eroding the edges of the hexagonal stones. Deep in the cave lie mysteries yet still to be uncovered, enticing beckoning you to enter.




#### DM NOTES
Deep in this cave is the flesh that hates, it transports the gang to a different world where they were back in their lvl 16 bodies fighting a few smaller monsters and a bigger fleshy monster
