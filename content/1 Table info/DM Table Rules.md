# Alcohol


What are the normal effects that would be removed by say using a tankard of sobriety. Is it just for RP? Is there some condition you are afflicted with such as a number of levels of exhaustion to imitate a hangover or the poisoned condition? Does it affect all skills negatively or does it not effect strength and constitution? In the context of spells and abilities such as Dwarven Resilience(advantage against poison) and Purify Food and Drink is alcohol and other intoxicating substances poison? Does different beverages and substances have the same effects or DC’s or does this vary? How does alcoholism function?

The closest thing we have to actual rules for the effects of alcohol so far is some of the consequences for lower-class carousing in Xanathar’s Guide.

So far my theory is this: for the first quantity of alchohol consumed, a character must make a DC 10 Constitution Saving throw or gain one level of inebriation, two if they failed by more than 5, 3 if they roll a 1, for every quantity after that the DC increases by 2. Abilities that give advantage on saving throws against poison would apply to this. Creatures immune to poison are not immune to inebriation but the DC for them only increases after the third quantity. The “quantity” referenced above is a pint for medium creatures, 2 pints for large creatures, 1/2 for small creatures, and so on with the pattern of multiplying by two for every size. A polymorphed creature’s apparent size is the one used for this calculation.

## There are multiple levels of inebriation:

1. Disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks

2. Disadvantage on Dexterity Checks

3. Automatic failure on checks mentioned in 1, in addition the next time the character wakens from a long rest they gain the poisoned condition. At this point shenanigans may occur at the DM’s discretion.

4. Every time the character stands or moves faster than half speed they must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution Saving Throw or fall prone/throw up, at the DM’s choice, if the DM chooses vomiting, the character removes 1 level of inebriation.

5. The character falls unconscious.

This is how I would treat alcohol consumption, but as this is only my idea, it is by no means perfect.
