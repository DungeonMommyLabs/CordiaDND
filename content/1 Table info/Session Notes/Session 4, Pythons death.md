During the fight with python [[Players/James Ravenhoorn]] died and got resurrected bij a grace of [[Characters/NPC's/Tyr, the Goddes of war, diplomacy, and peace]] saying he has a bigger role yet to play. during the fight [[Characters/NPC's/Avery Hopkins]] banged on the door hoping to get in but couldn't because [[Characters/Antagonists/Python DECEASED]] had locked the door as one of their last action. when the fight was over [[Players/James Ravenhoorn]]was unconscious, [[Players/Mikaela Mittens]] was barely standing and [[Players/BLOO]] was relatively ok.
Bloo walked out first, only to find [[Characters/NPC's/Avery Hopkins]] on the floor with a white-ish muzzle instead of their normal face, crying and sobbing with what seems to be an ice blast originating from their mouth.
